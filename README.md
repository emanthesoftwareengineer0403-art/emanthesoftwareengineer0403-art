### Hey, I'm Emmanuel Dareus! 👋

I'm a software and AI engineer based in Florida who loves bringing ideas to life by writing clean code and teaming up with advanced AI models. I focus on building smart applications that automate workflows and solve real-world problems.

### 💡 4 Key Things About Me
1. **AI-Driven Builder:** I don't just write code the old-school way—I use modern AI models and agentic workflows as co-pilots to architect and ship software fast.
2. **Currently Building Omnilogiq:** I am actively developing a custom, AI-powered "school OS" app designed to streamline and organize academic workflows.
3. **The 9-Month Mission:** I'm following a strict, high-intensity roadmap to master full-stack software engineering, automation, and system design.
4. **Driven & Disciplined:** Whether I'm tracking financial markets or training on the soccer field, I treat high-performance habits the same way I treat code.
